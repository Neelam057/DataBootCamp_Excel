# Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis
## Background
Billions of dollars have been raised through crowdfunding, with the global market expected to grow to $72.88 billion by 2032. To receive funding on these projects, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects to discover “the trick” to finding success.
### Objective
Here are the excel data analysis of 1000 sample projects to uncover hidden trends by examining different attributes and how they are affecting the growth or success of the project. Not every crowdfunding is successful. Of over 1000 projects, only half, i.e. 565 of the projects were successful.
