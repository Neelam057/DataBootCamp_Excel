# Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis

## Background
Billions of dollars have been raised through crowdfunding, with the global market expected to grow to $72.88 billion by 2032. To receive funding on these projects, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects to discover “the trick” to finding success.

### Objective
Here are the excel data analysis of 1000 sample projects to uncover hidden trends by examining different attributes and how they are affecting the growth or success of the project. Not every crowdfunding is successful. Of over 1000 projects, only half, i.e. 565 of the projects were successful.

#### Conclusion 1
After analyzing the data, it is concluded that four important factors which play a significant role in predicting success of the project and those are- the category of the project, the number of backers, goal and percent funded. As per the data, out of 1000 projects, 565 projects (56.5%) are more likely to be successful than to fail (36.4%) or get canceled (5.7%). In all the categories of projects, the number of successful projects is higher than the number of unsuccessful projects. If we look at graph 1, theater projects have the highest count of successful projects, followed by music, and film & video, whereas journalism () has the lowest count of projects followed by games and food. If we compare the success rate based on goal vs funding, then journalism (100%) is the most successful followed by technology (66.66%) and photography (61.9%). Although the success rate is high, the data is so small that it is not significant
